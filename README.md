This project uses machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements. 
The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

Project Overview-:
The Iris flower dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

1.Sepal length
2.Sepal width
3.Petal length
4.Petal width
The goal is to predict the species of the iris flower based on these features.

Dataset-:
The dataset contains three types of Iris species:

1.Setosa (Class 0)
2.Versicolor (Class 1)
3.Virginica (Class 2)
Each species has 50 samples in the dataset, and the four features are measured in centimeters.
